Norms and Distances


#Introduction
The ℓₚ norm measures the length or magnitude of a vector in d-dimensional space, written as ℝᵈ.
ℓₚ refers to a family of mathematical rules, each describing how to measure the length or magnitude of a vector.

A norm is a function that assigns a single non-negative number to a vector.
It tells you “how long” or “how big” the vector is.

‖·‖ : ℝᵈ → ℝ₊
Define a norm as a function from ℝᵈ to ℝ₊.
It takes a vector x ∈ ℝᵈ and returns a nonnegative real number ‖x‖ ∈ ℝ₊,
interpreted as the length or magnitude of x.

‖·‖ the norm operator (function name)
ℝᵈ the domain — the set of all d-dimensional real vectors x = (x₁, x₂, …, x_d).
ℝ₊ the codomain — the set of all nonnegative real numbers (ℝ₊ = { r ∈ ℝ | r ≥ 0 }).
· placeholder for any vector.

So the norm maps each vector x ∈ ℝᵈ to a nonnegative real number ‖x‖ ∈ ℝ₊,
interpreted as the “length” or “magnitude” of x.

A valid norm must satisfy three fundamental properties
for all vectors x, y ∈ ℝᵈ and all scalars α ∈ ℝ:

‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0
Identity property.
Only the zero vector has zero length.

‖αx‖ = |α|‖x‖
Homogeneity property.
Scaling a vector by α scales its length by |α|.

‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖
Triangle inequality.
The straight path is always the shortest one.


#Formal Definition


# Induced Distance (Metric)

The ℓₚ norm defines a family of ways to measure the length of a vector
by combining its coordinates according to the parameter p.

|x|ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p), for 1 ≤ p < ∞
|x|∞ = maxᵢ |xᵢ|

Define the ℓₚ norm of a vector x as the p-th root of the sum of the p-th powers of its absolute components.
For p between 1 and infinity, we raise each coordinate’s magnitude |xᵢ| to the power p,
sum over all coordinates i = 1 to d, and finally take the 1/p power of that sum.

When p equals infinity, we take the limit case,the maximum absolute coordinate.
So |x|∞ gives the largest magnitude among all components of x.


Σ the summation symbol, add up all terms from i = 1 to d
|xᵢ| the absolute value of the i-th component
p a real number ≥ 1
1/p the reciprocal exponent taking the p-th root of the sum
maxᵢ for p = ∞, take the largest absolute component value


#Manhattan or Taxicab Norm

Case 𝑝 = 1 p=1 — The ℓ₁ Norm

We now consider the specific case p = 1 in the general ℓₚ definition.

‖x‖₁ = Σ |xᵢ| , for i = 1 to d

Substituting 𝑝 = 1 p=1 into the ℓₚ formula removes the exponent and the root,
leaving only the sum of the absolute component magnitudes.

‖x‖ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p) ⟶ (for p = 1) ‖x‖₁ = Σ |xᵢ|

The ℓ₁ norm of x equals the sum of the absolute values of its coordinates.

#Distance Between Two Points

Using the ℓ₁ norm, we can define the distance between two points
p = (p₁, p₂, …, p_d) and q = (q₁, q₂, …, q_d) in ℝᵈ as the sum of the absolute coordinate differences.

D₁(p, q) = ‖p − q‖₁ = Σ |pᵢ − qᵢ| , for i = 1 to d

The distance between the two points p and q is obtained
by summing the absolute difference of each corresponding coordinate.
Each term |pᵢ − qᵢ| represents the movement along one axis,
and adding them together gives the total grid-based distance between the points.

#Euclidean Norm

Case p = 2 — The ℓ₂ Norm

We now consider the specific case p = 2 in the general ℓₚ definition.

‖x‖₂ = √( Σ |xᵢ|² ) , for i = 1 to d

Substituting p = 2 into the ℓₚ formula gives the square root of the sum of squared components.

‖x‖ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p) ⟶ (for p = 2) ‖x‖₂ = √( Σ |xᵢ|² )

The ℓ₂ norm corresponds to the familiar Euclidean length of a vector in space.
It measures the straight-line distance from the origin to the point x.

#Distance Between Two Points

Using the ℓ₂ norm, the distance between two points
p = (p₁, p₂, …, p_d) and q = (q₁, q₂, …, q_d) in ℝᵈ is defined as

D₂(p, q) = ‖p − q‖₂ = √( Σ (pᵢ − qᵢ)² ) , for i = 1 to d

the euclidean distance is the length of the straight line connection p and q.

#Chebyshev Norm

Case p = ∞ — The ℓ∞ Norm

We now consider the limit case as p approaches infinity in the general ℓₚ definition.

‖x‖∞ = limₚ→∞ ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p)

In the limit, the norm depends only on that maximal component

‖x‖∞ = maxᵢ |xᵢ|

The ℓ∞ norm therefore measures the greatest absolute value among all coordinates of x.

#Distance Between Two Points

Using the ℓ∞ norm, the distance between two points
p = (p₁, p₂, …, p_d) and q = (q₁, q₂, …, q_d) in ℝᵈ is defined as

D∞(p, q) = ‖p − q‖∞ = maxᵢ |pᵢ − qᵢ|


#Unit Balls

The unit ball of a norm is the set of all vectors whose length equals one:

Bₚ(1) = { x ∈ ℝ² : ‖x‖ₚ = 1 }

The set of all vectors x in ℝ² whose ℓₚ norm equals one.

It represents all points lying at unit distance from the origin under the chosen norm.

#Case p = 1 — The ℓ₁ Unit Ball (Diamond Shape)

‖x‖₁ = |x₁| + |x₂| = 1

The sum of the absolute values of x₁ and x₂ equals one.
The boundary forms a diamond touching the axes at (±1, 0) and (0, ±1)

#Case p = 2 — ℓ₂ Unit Ball (Circle)

‖x‖₂ = √(x₁² + x₂²) = 1
The square root of the sum of the squares of x₁ and x₂ equals one.

It represents all points that are exactly one unit away from the origin in Euclidean distance,
forming a perfect circle.

#Case p = ∞ — ℓ∞ Unit Ball (Square)

‖x‖∞ = max(|x₁|, |x₂|) = 1
The largest absolute coordinate of the vector equals one.

It includes all points whose coordinates stay within the range [−1, 1].
The boundary forms a square aligned with the coordinate axes.

#norm equivalence - finit dimension

All ℓₚ norms in finite-dimensional space ℝᵈ are equivalent.

There exist constants 0 < c ≤ C < ∞, depending only on d, p, and q,
such that for every vector x ∈ ℝᵈ:

c · ‖x‖_q ≤ ‖x‖_p ≤ C · ‖x‖_q

This means that all ℓₚ norms measure size in a comparable way.

Geometrically, this means the shapes of the unit balls are different
(diamond, circle, square in ℝ²), but each can fit inside a scaled version of the others.
They describe the same space, only stretched or compressed by constant factors.
