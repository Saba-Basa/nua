Norms and Distances

The ℓₚ norm measures the length or magnitude of a vector in d-dimensional space, written as ℝᵈ.

ℓₚ refers to a family of mathematical rules, each one describing how to measure the length (or magnitude) of a vector.

Norm → A norm is a function that assigns a single non-negative number to a vector.
It tells you “how long” or “how big” the vector is.
