#Framework
Step 1: Clarify
Break the question into its main components.
Identify the core concepts (nouns) and their relationships (verbs).
Define what each concept represents in the given context.

Step 2: Define
Write both the formal and intuitive meanings of all core terms.
Ensure every word you use has a precise and consistent meaning.

Step 3: Mechanism
Explain how one quantity or concept influences another.
Trace the logical or causal connection step by step.

Step 4: Example
Test the idea using the simplest possible examples.
Use low-dimensional or concrete cases to check your reasoning.

Step 5: Pattern
Extract the general rule or invariant that holds across cases.
Express it symbolically or as a concise statement.

Step 6: Reflect
Restate the insight in clear, plain language.
If you can explain it simply and correctly, you understand it deeply.


Q3: How does intrinsic dimension affect distances and neighborhoods?

# Core objects
What are the main things the question is about?
intrinsic dimension
distances
neighborhoods

# Relationship type
affect -> causation/influence

# Interpretation
A: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence distances?
B: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence neighborhood structure?

---------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Define
Write both the formal and intuitive meanings of all core terms.

intrinsic dimension
I1:
part and parcel of the system. It tells how many independent directions belong to the system itself.
one for a line, two for a plane, three for a volume.

F1:
Let M ⊂ ℝᵈ be a smooth manifold of dimension m.
Then the intrinsic dimension of M is m; it is the number of independent coordinates
needed to describe points on M. M is a subset of ℝᵈ.

### Core objects

## manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ
I1:
Any shape, for example a torus, sits in ℝ³. Every point on the torus surface needs
two numbers to locate it: one angle around the ring, one angle around the tube.
That's why it's a 2D manifold. Even though the torus lives in 3D space, you only
move in two independent directions when you stay on the surface.

Same with a sheet of paper. You need two distances to find any spot on the sheet.
If you bend the paper through space, the points still only need two coordinates
to describe their position on the sheet itself.

Locally, both surfaces are flat. Globally, they can be curved or bent through the
larger space.

F1:
A smooth manifold of dimension m is a set M such that every point x ∈ M
has a neighborhood U ⊂ M and a map φ : U → ℝᵐ that is a homeomorphism onto its image.
The collection of such pairs (U, φ) is called an atlas.
If all transition maps φ_j ∘ φ_i⁻¹ between overlapping charts are smooth,
then M is a smooth (differentiable) manifold.
