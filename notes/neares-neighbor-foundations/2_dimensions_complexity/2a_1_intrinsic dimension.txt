Q3: How does intrinsic dimension affect distances and neighborhoods?

# Core objects
What are the main things the question is about?
intrinsic dimension
distances
neighborhoods

# Relationship type
affect -> causation/influence

# Interpretation
A: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence distances?
B: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence neighborhood structure?

---------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Define
Write both the formal and intuitive meanings of all core terms.
---------------------------------------------

intrinsic dimension
I1:
part and parcel of the system. It tells how many independent directions belong to the system itself.
one for a line, two for a plane, three for a volume.

F1:
Let M ⊂ ℝᵈ be a smooth manifold of dimension m.
Then the intrinsic dimension of M is m; it is the number of independent coordinates
needed to describe points on M. M is a subset of ℝᵈ.

---------------------------------------------
### Core objects
---------------------------------------------

## manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ
I1:
Any shape, for example a torus, sits in ℝ³. Every point on the torus surface needs
two numbers to locate it: one angle around the ring, one angle around the tube.
That's why it's a 2D manifold. Even though the torus lives in 3D space, you only
move in two independent directions when you stay on the surface.

Same with a sheet of paper. You need two distances to find any spot on the sheet.
If you bend the paper through space, the points still only need two coordinates
to describe their position on the sheet itself.

Locally, both surfaces are flat. Globally, they can be curved or bent through the
larger space.

F1:
A smooth manifold of dimension m is a set M such that every point x ∈ M
has a neighborhood U ⊂ M and a map φ : U → ℝᵐ that is a homeomorphism onto its image.
The collection of such pairs (U, φ) is called an atlas.
If all transition maps φ_j ∘ φ_i⁻¹ between overlapping charts are smooth,
then M is a smooth (differentiable) manifold.

## Point on the manifold  x ∈ M

I1 (Intuitive meaning):
A point on a manifold is a single position on the shape.
It has no size, no area, no volume; it is purely a location.
Even if the manifold is embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space,
each point still lies on the manifold, not elsewhere in that space.
The ambient space may give global coordinates, but the manifold itself
restricts which positions are allowed.
A point is simply one such allowed location on the shape.

F1 (Formal meaning):
A point is an element of the set M.

------------------------------------------------------------
Q1 — What object contains the thing I am defining?
------------------------------------------------------------

A topology is a collection of subsets of a set; it cannot exist without the set.
A function is defined as a set of ordered pairs (x, y); it requires a set.
All spaces in mathematics begin as:  set  +  extra structure.
You cannot have the extra structure without the underlying set.

Coordinates come from charts,
charts come from functions,
functions come from sets.

Conceptual layers:
Layer 1: Set                (points exist)
Layer 2: Topology           (neighborhoods exist)
Layer 3: Differentiability  (charts exist)
Layer 4: Metric             (distances exist)
Layer 5: Curvature          (bending exists)

A point sits at Layer 1.
Therefore Q1 chooses:  the set M.

Why must the point belong to the lowest layer?
A point needs no structure at all:
not topology,
not differentiability,
not metric,
not coordinates.

All a point needs is a collection it belongs to.

A set is the minimal mathematical structure that can contain objects.
A manifold, topology, metric, or chart cannot exist without first having a set.

Therefore, the primitive identity of a point is:
an element of the set M.

## local neighborhood U ⊂ M
Step 1:
Object: local neighborhood U
Ambient theory: manifold M
Step 2:
Q1: What bigger structure does it belong to?
U is a subset of M
Q2: What is its simplest form? 
U ⊂ M
  I1 (Intuitive meaning):
    - How should I think about this object?
    - What is its informal purpose or function in the theory?
    Why does manifold theroy introduce neighborhoods at all?
    A neighborhood is the object that allows you to restrict attention to a small region around a point.
    A neighborhood is a region. so it is a local construction.

Q: What distinguishes a neighborhood from just any subset of the manifold?
A neighborhood contains the point.
Q: Why do we need to restrict attention locally on a manifold?
A manifold could be globally huge, messy and complicated.
Even if the whole thing is complicated. A small part could be simpler to study.
Each tiny piece is easier than the whole thing.
We restrict attention locally because the local part around a point is simpler to study than the whole manifold.
What do we need when we want to study something locally?
A region around the point
A subspace that contains the point
A neighborhood
Therefore:
We restrict attention locally because global behavior may be complicated,
but local behavior around a point is simple and studyable.
A neighborhood is the tool that isolates that simple region.”

F1:
"Suppose X is a topological space, p ∈ X, and S ⊂ X.
 A neighborhood of p is an open subset containing p."
 — J.M. Lee, *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*, Appendix A: Review of Topology,
   Springer GTM 218, 2nd Edition, p. 596

A neighborhood of a point x ∈ M is a subset U ⊂ M that contains
an open set V with x ∈ V ⊂ U.

Q3:
Why the object exists
what job it performs inside the theory
what operations require this object

#: Topological Foundations
1. Topological Space  
Definition: Topological Space
"A topology on X is a collection T of subsets of X, called open subsets, satisfying
 (i) X and ∅ are open.
 (ii) The union of any family of open subsets is open.
 (iii) The intersection of any finite family of open subsets is open.
A pair (X, T) consisting of a set X together with a topology T on X is called a
topological space."

objects:
  topological space: (X, T)
  objects inside:
    - X is a set (the raw container of points)
    - T is a Collection of subsets of X
    - elements of T are open subsets (U ⊆ X where U ∈ T)

0. Why do we start with an arbitrary set 𝑋 with no structure, 
instead of starting with something specific like 𝑅?
The set X, give no structure, nothing. The Topology T adds an open set on top of X.
Both are part of the object: topological space (X,T)
The Topology is general;
any collection of points can become a space. We can model, discrete spaces, fractals and so on.
If we would start with 𝑅, imposes geometry. 𝑅 has a ordering and algebraic and metric structure.
This gives cloeness etc.
So the reason we begin with a bare set is to keep the theory general enough to apply to any collection of points, not only geometric subsets of 
𝑅.

1. If X is arbitrary, what actually determines the structure of the space?
The topology 𝑇 determines all structure.
So far we know:
𝑋 is just a set.
𝑇 is a collection of subsets of 
𝑋 (the open sets).
A topological space is (𝑋,𝑇).

#What becomes defined only after you choose the topology 𝑇 ?
#What does choosing T mean: deciding which subset of X are open.
So if you change the open sets, the concept changes.

#What is “the concept” that changes when you change the open sets?
A topology on a set X is the pair (X, T), where T is the collection of open sets.
Changing the open sets means changing T.
Since a topological space is the pair (X, T), changing T changes the object (X, T).
Therefore, the “concept” that changes when you change the open sets
is the topological space itself.

#If you change the topology and thereby change the topological space,
what specific mathematical notions change as a result?

3. Give examples of three different topologies on the same set.

4. What does a topology allow us to define that a bare set cannot?

8. How does the concept of a topology lead to the notion of a manifold?

10. What is the smallest topology you can put on a set? What is the largest?

11. How does the choice of topology affect continuity?

12. Can two topologies on the same set make different functions continuous?

13. What role do open sets play compared to closed sets?

14. How do neighborhoods relate to open sets?

15. Why do we require closure under finite intersections but not infinite ones?

16. How can we compare two topologies on the same set? (coarser/finer)

17. What is the significance of the indiscrete and discrete topologies?

18. How do convergence and sequences depend on the topology?

19. Give an example of a non-metric topology. Why is it still a topology?

20. Why is the Euclidean topology on ℝ not the only possible topology on ℝ?
