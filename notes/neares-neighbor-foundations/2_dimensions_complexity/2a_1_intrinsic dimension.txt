Q3: How does intrinsic dimension affect distances and neighborhoods?

# Core objects
What are the main things the question is about?
intrinsic dimension
distances
neighborhoods

# Relationship type
affect -> causation/influence

# Interpretation
A: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence distances?
B: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence neighborhood structure?

---------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Define
Write both the formal and intuitive meanings of all core terms.
---------------------------------------------

intrinsic dimension
I1:
part and parcel of the system. It tells how many independent directions belong to the system itself.
one for a line, two for a plane, three for a volume.

F1:
Let M ⊂ ℝᵈ be a smooth manifold of dimension m.
Then the intrinsic dimension of M is m; it is the number of independent coordinates
needed to describe points on M. M is a subset of ℝᵈ.

---------------------------------------------
### Core objects
---------------------------------------------

## manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ
I1:
Any shape, for example a torus, sits in ℝ³. Every point on the torus surface needs
two numbers to locate it: one angle around the ring, one angle around the tube.
That's why it's a 2D manifold. Even though the torus lives in 3D space, you only
move in two independent directions when you stay on the surface.

Same with a sheet of paper. You need two distances to find any spot on the sheet.
If you bend the paper through space, the points still only need two coordinates
to describe their position on the sheet itself.

Locally, both surfaces are flat. Globally, they can be curved or bent through the
larger space.

F1:
A smooth manifold of dimension m is a set M such that every point x ∈ M
has a neighborhood U ⊂ M and a map φ : U → ℝᵐ that is a homeomorphism onto its image.
The collection of such pairs (U, φ) is called an atlas.
If all transition maps φ_j ∘ φ_i⁻¹ between overlapping charts are smooth,
then M is a smooth (differentiable) manifold.

## Point on the manifold  x ∈ M

I1 (Intuitive meaning):
A point on a manifold is a single position on the shape.
It has no size, no area, no volume; it is purely a location.
Even if the manifold is embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space,
each point still lies on the manifold, not elsewhere in that space.
The ambient space may give global coordinates, but the manifold itself
restricts which positions are allowed.
A point is simply one such allowed location on the shape.

F1 (Formal meaning):
A point is an element of the set M.

------------------------------------------------------------
Q1 — What object contains the thing I am defining?
------------------------------------------------------------

A topology is a collection of subsets of a set; it cannot exist without the set.
A function is defined as a set of ordered pairs (x, y); it requires a set.
All spaces in mathematics begin as:  set  +  extra structure.
You cannot have the extra structure without the underlying set.

Coordinates come from charts,
charts come from functions,
functions come from sets.

Conceptual layers:
Layer 1: Set                (points exist)
Layer 2: Topology           (neighborhoods exist)
Layer 3: Differentiability  (charts exist)
Layer 4: Metric             (distances exist)
Layer 5: Curvature          (bending exists)

A point sits at Layer 1.
Therefore Q1 chooses:  the set M.

Why must the point belong to the lowest layer?
A point needs no structure at all:
not topology,
not differentiability,
not metric,
not coordinates.

All a point needs is a collection it belongs to.

A set is the minimal mathematical structure that can contain objects.
A manifold, topology, metric, or chart cannot exist without first having a set.

Therefore, the primitive identity of a point is:
an element of the set M.

## local neighborhood U ⊂ M
Step 1:
Object: local neighborhood U
Ambient theory: manifold M
Step 2:
Q1: What bigger structure does it belong to?
U is a subset of M
Q2: What is its simplest form? 
U ⊂ M
  I1 (Intuitive meaning):
    - How should I think about this object?
    - What is its informal purpose or function in the theory?
    Why does manifold theroy introduce neighborhoods at all?
    A neighborhood is the object that allows you to restrict attention to a small region around a point.
    A neighborhood is a region. so it is a local construction.

Q: What distinguishes a neighborhood from just any subset of the manifold?
A neighborhood contains the point.
Q: Why do we need to restrict attention locally on a manifold?
A manifold could be globally huge, messy and complicated.
Even if the whole thing is complicated. A small part could be simpler to study.
Each tiny piece is easier than the whole thing.
We restrict attention locally because the local part around a point is simpler to study than the whole manifold.
What do we need when we want to study something locally?
A region around the point
A subspace that contains the point
A neighborhood
Therefore:
We restrict attention locally because global behavior may be complicated,
but local behavior around a point is simple and studyable.
A neighborhood is the tool that isolates that simple region.”

"Suppose X is a topological space, p ∈ X, and S ⊂ X.
 A neighborhood of p is an open subset containing p."
 — J.M. Lee, *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*, Appendix A: Review of Topology,
   Springer GTM 218, 2nd Edition, p. 596

A neighborhood of a point x ∈ M is a subset U ⊂ M that contains
an open set V with x ∈ V ⊂ U.

Q3:
Why the object exists
what job it performs inside the theory
what operations require this object

#: Topological Foundations
1. Topological Space  
Definition: Topological Space
"A topology on X is a collection T of subsets of X, called open subsets, satisfying
 (i) X and ∅ are open.
 (ii) The union of any family of open subsets is open.
 (iii) The intersection of any finite family of open subsets is open.
A pair (X, T) consisting of a set X together with a topology T on X is called a
topological space."

objects:
  topological space: (X, T)
  objects inside:
    - X is a set (the raw container of points)
    - T is a Collection of subsets of X
    - elements of T are open subsets (U ⊆ X where U ∈ T)

###goal Definition → component → clause → axiom → consequence

##unpack what (X,T) is and what “subset of X” means.
Q1: In the object (X, T), what is X?

A1: X is a set. A set is defined simply as a collection of elements, with no
    assumptions about what these elements are or what properties they have.

Q2: In the object (X, T), what is T?
T is a set whose elements are subsets of X, and these subsets are declared to be the "open sets" of the space.

Q3: What does it mean that T is a set?
A3: T is a collection of objects. In this case, the objects collected inside T are subsets of X.

Q4: What does it mean that the elements of T are subsets of X?
A4: A subset of X is any set whose elements all come from X. Every U in T satisfies U ⊆ X
it contains only elements that already belong to X

##introduce “declaring U open” as a choice of membership in T⊆P(X).
Q5: Can you give a concrete example of X and a subset U ⊆ X?
If X = {a, b, c}, then U = {a, c} is a subset of X

A5: To "declare" a subset open means:

     (1) We start with the power set P(X).
         The power set P(X) is the set of all subsets of X. It gives us the
         full collection of candidates from which we may choose open sets.

     (2) T is chosen as a subset of P(X).
         That means every element U of T is itself a subset of X (U ⊆ X).

     (3) Openness is defined by logical equivalence:
               "U is open" ⇔ U ∈ T.
         This means that being open is not proved from a property of U; it is
         assigned entirely by its membership in T. The definition is purely
         syntactic.

     (4) This becomes an axiom of the structure (X, T).
         A topology must satisfy the standard axioms (∅ and X are open,
         arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open).
         These axioms ensure that the declared open sets behave in a way that
         supports continuity and limits.

     (5) In this context:
         Declaring U open means that openness is introduced by definition,
         not discovered. We create the topological structure by specifying T.


## What is the precise definition of “U is open” in terms of the topology T?
Q6: What does it mean for a subset to be "open" in this context?

A6: 
We have a topological space (X, T).
By definition, a subset U ⊆ X is open exactly when U ∈ T.

Example:
  Let X = {a, b, c}.
  Its power set is
    P(X) = { ∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c} }.
  Choose
    T = { ∅, {a,c}, X }.

    - Here X = {a,b,c} is the underlying set of points.
    - Writing X inside the braces of T means we are also treating the whole set X
      itself as one of the open sets, i.e. X ∈ T.
    - This is required by the topology axioms: every topology must contain ∅ and X.

Then (X, T) is a topological space, and “open in this context” means
“is an element of T”.

So:
  - {a,c} is open because {a,c} ∈ T.
  - {b} is not open because {b} ∉ T.

Short version:
  “U is open” ⇔ “U is one of the subsets we put into T”.

## How do the topology axioms (∅, X, unions, finite intersections) constrain and shape the structure of T?
#axiom 1: ∅ is open
Q7: The definition says that ∅ must be in T. What is the empty set ∅?

Q8: Why is ∅ considered a subset of every set X?

Q9: If T did NOT contain ∅, what part of the topology axioms would fail?

#axiom 2: X is open
Q10: The definition says that X must be in T. What does it mean for a set
      to contain itself as a subset?

Q11: Why must the whole space X be open in every topology?

Q12: What goes wrong if X ∉ T?

#axiom 3: Arbitrary unions of open sets are open
Q13: What does “arbitrary union” mean in mathematics?

Q14: If you take a collection of sets {U_i} with each U_i ∈ T,
      what does their union ⋃ U_i represent inside X?

Q15: Why must this union also belong to T for T to be a topology?

Q16: What would break if T were NOT closed under arbitrary unions?

#axiom 4: Finite intersections of open sets are open
Q17: What is meant by a “finite intersection” of sets?

Q18: If U and V are in T, what does U ∩ V represent inside X?

Q19: Why does the definition require intersections only for finitely many open sets, 
not infinitely many?

Q20: What structure would fail if T were not closed under finite intersections?

# Constraint on T
Q21: Given all four axioms, 
what kinds of collections of subsets of X are ruled out from being valid topologies?

Q22: How do these axioms force T to be stable under basic set operations?

## Why does openness depend entirely on the chosen topology T, 
and how can the same subset be open in one topology and not in another?

Q23: In our definition, how is openness defined? 
Does it depend onthe subset U itself, or on whether U is included in T?

Q24: If we take the same set X but choose two different collections T₁ and T₂,
do we get the same open sets or different ones?

Q25: Can a subset U be in T₁ but not in T₂? 
What would that imply about U’s status as an “open set”?

Q26: Does a subset have an intrinsic quality that makes it open, 
or is openness assigned by placing it into T?

Q27: What does this tell us about openness: is it an inherent geometric property,
or is it relative to the chosen topology?

Q28: If openness depends on T, 
what happens to all topological notionsdefined in terms of 
open sets (continuity, neighborhoods, convergence)?


## Conceptual Layering: Why do we start with X, and what role does T play?

1. Why do we start with an arbitrary set 𝑋 with no structure, 
instead of starting with something specific like 𝑅?
The set X, give no structure, nothing. The Topology T adds an open set on top of X.
Both are part of the object: topological space (X,T)
The Topology is general;
any collection of points can become a space. We can model, discrete spaces, fractals and so on.
If we would start with 𝑅, imposes geometry. 𝑅 has a ordering and algebraic and metric structure.
This gives cloeness etc.
So the reason we begin with a bare set is 
to keep the theory general enough to apply to any collection of points, 
not only geometric subsets of 𝑅.

2. If X is arbitrary, what actually determines the structure of the space?
The topology 𝑇 determines all structure.
So far we know:
𝑋 is just a set.
𝑇 is a collection of subsets of 
𝑋 (the open sets).
A topological space is (𝑋,𝑇).

#What becomes defined only after you choose the topology 𝑇 ?
#What does choosing T mean: deciding which subset of X are open.
So if you change the open sets, the concept changes.

#What is “the concept” that changes when you change the open sets?
A topology on a set X is the pair (X, T), where T is the collection of open sets.
Changing the open sets means changing T.
Since a topological space is the pair (X, T), changing T changes the object (X, T).
Therefore, the “concept” that changes when you change the open sets
is the topological space itself.

#If you change the topology and thereby change the topological space,
what specific mathematical notions change as a result?

3. Interior / Exterior / Closure / Boundary  
4. Continuous Map  
5. Homeomorphism
