Setup. Let V = ℝᵈ.

Definition (Norm). A map ‖·‖ : V → [0, ∞) with
(i) ‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0,
(ii) ‖αx‖ = |α|‖x‖ for α ∈ ℝ,
(iii) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖.

Definition (Metric induced by a norm).
d(x, y) := ‖x − y‖. Then d is a metric on V.

Examples (ℓₚ norms on ℝᵈ).
For 1 ≤ p < ∞:
‖x‖ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p),  i = 1,…,d.

For p = ∞:
‖x‖∞ = max₁≤ᵢ≤d |xᵢ|.

Induced distances:
dₚ(x, y) = ‖x − y‖ₚ.


Interpretation.
We work in a vector space V = ℝᵈ, where each point is a d-tuple of numbers.
To compare two points x, y ∈ V, we need a rule that tells us how far apart they are.
The norm provides this rule, it assigns a nonnegative length to every vector.

Geometric meaning.
‖x‖ is the length of the vector x.
‖x − y‖ is the distance between the points x and y.
Thus, the norm defines the geometry of the space.

Example.
Let each point x ∈ ℝᵈ represent a patient.
Each coordinate xᵢ is a medical feature such as blood pressure, heart rate, or temperature.
The Euclidean distance ‖x − y‖₂ then measures how different two patients are in their vital signs.

Interpretation in data analysis.
A small distance means two patients have similar measurements.
A large distance means their features differ strongly.
By defining distance this way, we can apply geometric reasoning to data.
For example, to find the nearest neighbor, cluster similar patients, or detect anomalies.

Summary.
The norm is the foundation for defining distance.
The distance determines similarity.
Similarity determines how we compare, group, or predict data points.
This chain: norm → distance → similarity, underlies all nearest-neighbor methods.

#degree of freedom
A degree of freedom is one independent direction in which data can change
without being determined by other variables.

Formally, in ℝᵈ each coordinate axis represents one potential degree of freedom.
But in real data, not all coordinates vary independently.
The number of truly independent variations gives the intrinsic dimension.

Example: 
If each point represents a patient with (height, weight, age, blood pressure),
these four features form a 4D space.
But height and weight are correlated, they vary together.
So the data may effectively vary along only 3 independent directions: 3 degrees of freedom.

#intrinsic dimension
Once we understand degrees of freedom, we can define the intrinsic dimension:
it is the number of independent directions (degrees of freedom) 
that describe the meaningful variation in the data.

# Why Intrinsic Dimension Matters

If data lie on an m-dimensional manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ,  
then M is a smooth surface of dimension m inside the d-dimensional real space ℝᵈ.  
Here d is the number of coordinates in the ambient space,  
and m is the number of independent directions in which the data can vary (m ≤ d). 

Q1: What does it mean that the data "lie on an m-dimensional manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ"?
"M is a subset of R superscript d"

ℝᵈ = { (x₁, x₂, …, x_d) | each xᵢ is a real number }
"the set of all points with d real coordinates"

In your own words:
How are the data points arranged inside the full d-dimensional space?
Describe the shape/structure you imagine when you hear "the data lie on a manifold".

Q1.1: what is a real coordinate 

Start with the real line ℝ.  
Each point on this line is described by one real number x₁.  
If we add a second line for another direction,  
a point now needs two numbers (x₁, x₂) to locate it.  
Each of these numbers is called a coordinate.  
A real coordinate is therefore one real number  
that tells how far a point lies along a given axis in space.

Q1.2: What does it mean to have all points with d real coordinates?

If one number gives position on a line,  
then two numbers describe position on a flat plane.  
Three numbers describe a point in space.  
If we keep adding numbers, we get more directions to move.  
All possible points made from d real numbers form the space ℝᵈ.  
So ℝᵈ means every point that can be written as (x₁, x₂, …, x_d).


Q1.3: What is a dimension?

Each new coordinate axis adds one direction to move.  
One axis gives a line (1D).  
Two axes make a plane (2D).  
Three axes make space (3D).  
The number of axes is the dimension d.  
In ℝᵈ, d tells how many independent directions exist.  
Each axis is one degree of freedom for the point’s position.

Q1.4: What is a manifold?

A manifold is a smooth shape that can bend inside a larger space ℝᵈ.  
It has its own dimension m, which is how many directions exist on the shape itself.  
For example, a surface in ℝ³ has m = 2 and d = 3.  
In datasets, the data points often lie close to such a lower-dimensional manifold.


Q1: What does it mean that the data "lie on an m-dimensional manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ"?
"M is a subset of R superscript d"

ℝᵈ = { (x₁, x₂, …, x_d) | each xᵢ is a real number }
"the set of all points with d real coordinates"

In your own words:
How are the data points arranged inside the full d-dimensional space?
Describe the shape/structure you imagine when you hear "the data lie on a manifold".

The data live in a large space with d coordinates,  
but they vary only along m independent directions.  
These directions form a smooth m-dimensional manifold M inside ℝᵈ.  
So the data occupy only a small, structured part of the full space.





-----

the number of neighbors within radius r grows approximately as rᵐ.  
This relation governs how distances and densities scale.

When m is small, distances preserve meaningful similarity,  
and nearby points remain close in structure.  
When m is large, distances become less informative  
because most points are almost equally far apart.  
In such cases, nearest-neighbor relations and geometric algorithms become unstable.

The intrinsic dimension therefore determines how distances behave  
and how effectively geometry-based methods operate in high-dimensional data.
