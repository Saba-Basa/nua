Setup. Let V = ℝᵈ.

Definition (Norm). A map ‖·‖ : V → [0, ∞) with
(i) ‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0,
(ii) ‖αx‖ = |α|‖x‖ for α ∈ ℝ,
(iii) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖.

Definition (Metric induced by a norm).
d(x, y) := ‖x − y‖. Then d is a metric on V.

Examples (ℓₚ norms on ℝᵈ).
For 1 ≤ p < ∞:
‖x‖ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p),  i = 1,…,d.

For p = ∞:
‖x‖∞ = max₁≤ᵢ≤d |xᵢ|.

Induced distances:
dₚ(x, y) = ‖x − y‖ₚ.


Interpretation.
We work in a vector space V = ℝᵈ, where each point is a d-tuple of numbers.
To compare two points x, y ∈ V, we need a rule that tells us how far apart they are.
The norm provides this rule, it assigns a nonnegative length to every vector.

Geometric meaning.
‖x‖ is the length of the vector x.
‖x − y‖ is the distance between the points x and y.
Thus, the norm defines the geometry of the space.

Example.
Let each point x ∈ ℝᵈ represent a patient.
Each coordinate xᵢ is a medical feature such as blood pressure, heart rate, or temperature.
The Euclidean distance ‖x − y‖₂ then measures how different two patients are in their vital signs.

Interpretation in data analysis.
A small distance means two patients have similar measurements.
A large distance means their features differ strongly.
By defining distance this way, we can apply geometric reasoning to data.
For example, to find the nearest neighbor, cluster similar patients, or detect anomalies.

Summary.
The norm is the foundation for defining distance.
The distance determines similarity.
Similarity determines how we compare, group, or predict data points.
This chain: norm → distance → similarity, underlies all nearest-neighbor methods.

#degree of freedom
A degree of freedom is one independent direction in which data can change
without being determined by other variables.

Formally, in ℝᵈ each coordinate axis represents one potential degree of freedom.
But in real data, not all coordinates vary independently.
The number of truly independent variations gives the intrinsic dimension.

Example: 
If each point represents a patient with (height, weight, age, blood pressure),
these four features form a 4D space.
But height and weight are correlated, they vary together.
So the data may effectively vary along only 3 independent directions: 3 degrees of freedom.

#intrinsic dimension
Once we understand degrees of freedom, we can define the intrinsic dimension:
it is the number of independent directions (degrees of freedom) 
that describe the meaningful variation in the data.
