Setup. Let V = ℝᵈ.

Definition (Norm). A map ‖·‖ : V → [0, ∞) with
(i) ‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0,
(ii) ‖αx‖ = |α|‖x‖ for α ∈ ℝ,
(iii) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖.

Definition (Metric induced by a norm).
d(x, y) := ‖x − y‖. Then d is a metric on V.

Examples (ℓₚ norms on ℝᵈ).
For 1 ≤ p < ∞:
‖x‖ₚ = ( Σ |xᵢ|ᵖ )^(1/p),  i = 1,…,d.

For p = ∞:
‖x‖∞ = max₁≤ᵢ≤d |xᵢ|.

Induced distances:
dₚ(x, y) = ‖x − y‖ₚ.


Interpretation.
We work in a vector space V = ℝᵈ, where each point is a d-tuple of numbers.
To compare two points x, y ∈ V, we need a rule that tells us how far apart they are.
The norm provides this rule, it assigns a nonnegative length to every vector.

Geometric meaning.
‖x‖ is the length of the vector x.
‖x − y‖ is the distance between the points x and y.
Thus, the norm defines the geometry of the space.

Example.
Let each point x ∈ ℝᵈ represent a patient.
Each coordinate xᵢ is a medical feature such as blood pressure, heart rate, or temperature.
The Euclidean distance ‖x − y‖₂ then measures how different two patients are in their vital signs.

Interpretation in data analysis.
A small distance means two patients have similar measurements.
A large distance means their features differ strongly.
By defining distance this way, we can apply geometric reasoning to data.
For example, to find the nearest neighbor, cluster similar patients, or detect anomalies.

Summary.
The norm is the foundation for defining distance.
The distance determines similarity.
Similarity determines how we compare, group, or predict data points.
This chain: norm → distance → similarity, underlies all nearest-neighbor methods.

#degree of freedom
A degree of freedom is one independent direction in which data can change
without being determined by other variables.

Formally, in ℝᵈ each coordinate axis represents one potential degree of freedom.
But in real data, not all coordinates vary independently.
The number of truly independent variations gives the intrinsic dimension.

Example: 
If each point represents a patient with (height, weight, age, blood pressure),
these four features form a 4D space.
But height and weight are correlated, they vary together.
So the data may effectively vary along only 3 independent directions: 3 degrees of freedom.

# Why Intrinsic Dimension Matters

Setup.  
Let the ambient space be V = ℝᵈ, equipped with a norm ‖·‖ and the induced metric  
d(x, y) = ‖x − y‖.  
Assume the data lie on (or near) a smooth **embedded** manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ  
of intrinsic dimension m ≤ d.

### Definition (Smooth Embedded Manifold)

A set M ⊂ ℝᵈ is a smooth embedded manifold of dimension m  
if for every point x ∈ M there exists an open neighborhood  
V ⊂ ℝᵈ and a smooth map  
ψ : V → ℝ^{d−m}  
such that

- ψ(x) = 0,  
- the derivative Dψ(x) has full rank d − m, and  
- M ∩ V = { y ∈ V | ψ(y) = 0 }.

Then M is locally a smooth m-dimensional surface inside ℝᵈ,  
and **inherits** the Euclidean metric from the ambient space:

d_M(x, y) = ‖x − y‖  for all x, y ∈ M.

### Local Coordinates

Locally, M behaves like ℝᵐ.  
For each point x ∈ M, there exists an open set U ⊂ M  
and a smooth coordinate map (a **chart**)  
φ : U → ℝᵐ  
that is a homeomorphism onto its image.  
A collection of such charts that cover M and have smooth overlaps  
is called an **atlas**.  

Intuitively, each chart provides a “flat” coordinate system  
for a small region of M, even if M is curved globally.

### Geometric Interpretation

- The ambient dimension **d** is the number of coordinates of the surrounding space.  
- The intrinsic dimension **m** is the number of independent directions in which the data vary on M.  
- Each neighborhood U ⊂ M looks like flat space ℝᵐ,  
  even though M itself may curve within ℝᵈ.

Example:  
A 2D sphere surface inside ℝ³ is a smooth manifold with m = 2, d = 3.  
Locally, it looks like a plane, but globally it wraps into a sphere.

### Summary

M is not a flat plane but a smooth m-dimensional surface embedded in ℝᵈ.  
It inherits its metric from the ambient space,  
so distances and neighborhoods on M are computed  
using the same Euclidean norm of ℝᵈ, restricted to points on M.

Q1: What does it mean that the data "lie on an m-dimensional manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ"?
"M is a subset of R superscript d"

ℝᵈ = { (x₁, x₂, …, x_d) | each xᵢ is a real number }
"the set of all points with d real coordinates"

In your own words:
How are the data points arranged inside the full d-dimensional space?
Describe the shape or structure you imagine when you hear "the data lie on a manifold".

---

Q1.1: What is a real coordinate?  
Start with the real line ℝ.  
Each point on this line is described by one real number x₁.  
If we add a second line for another direction,  
a point now needs two numbers (x₁, x₂) to locate it.  
Each number is called a coordinate.  
A real coordinate is therefore one real number  
that tells how far a point lies along a given axis.

---

Q1.2: What does it mean to have all points with d real coordinates?  
One number gives position on a line,  
two describe position on a plane,  
three describe a point in space.  
If we keep adding numbers, we add directions to move.  
All possible points made from d real numbers form the space ℝᵈ.  
So ℝᵈ means every point that can be written as (x₁, x₂, …, x_d).

---

Q1.3: What is a dimension?  
Each new coordinate axis adds one independent direction.  
One axis gives a line (1D).  
Two axes make a plane (2D).  
Three axes make space (3D).  
The number of axes is the dimension d.  
Each axis is one degree of freedom for a point’s position.

---

Q1.4: What is a manifold?  
A manifold is a space that, around every point, looks like flat space ℝᵐ.  
It may curve inside a larger space ℝᵈ,  
but locally it can be described by m real coordinates.  
Each small region behaves like ℝᵐ,  
and all such regions together form a continuous whole.  
Formally, every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of ℝᵐ.  
If all local descriptions fit smoothly, the space is called a smooth manifold.

---

Q1.4.1: What is a chart?  
A chart is a local map that assigns coordinates to a small region of a manifold.  
It tells how to describe points there using m numbers, just like in ℝᵐ.  
Formally, a chart is a pair (U, φ),  
where U is an open set on the manifold,  
and φ : U → ℝᵐ is a homeomorphism onto its image.  
This means the map and its inverse are continuous,  
so the local structure matches smoothly.

---

Q1.4.2: What is an atlas?  
An atlas is a collection of charts that together cover the whole manifold.  
Each chart handles one region,  
and where two charts overlap, their coordinates agree smoothly.  
All charts fitting together form the atlas of the manifold.

---

Q1.4.3: What does homeomorphic mean?  
Two spaces are homeomorphic if their points can be matched one-to-one  
by a map that is continuous in both directions.  
Such a map is a bijective continuous map with a continuous inverse.  
Intuitively, one space can be stretched or bent into the other  
without cutting or gluing anything.  
They have the same overall shape and connectivity.

---

Summary of Q1:  
The data live in a large space with d coordinates  
but vary only along m independent directions.  
These directions form a smooth m-dimensional manifold M inside ℝᵈ.  
So the data occupy only a small, structured part of the full space.

---

Q2: Why does the intrinsic dimension m matter?

Q2.1: What does intrinsic mean?  
Intrinsic means a property that can be measured or defined  
entirely from within the object itself,  
without referring to anything outside it.  
Example: the surface area of a sphere is intrinsic,  
but its position in space is not.

---

Q2.2: What is meant by “dimension” in this context?  
Dimension tells how many independent directions exist within a space.  
In a manifold M, it is the minimum number of coordinates  
needed to describe points locally on M.

---

Q2.3: What does intrinsic dimension mean then?  
Intrinsic dimension is the number of directions that exist within the data itself,  
without considering extra coordinates from the surrounding space ℝᵈ.  
It shows the true degrees of freedom of the data.

---

Q2.4: How can data have a smaller intrinsic dimension than the space they are in?  
Because the data may only vary along a few directions inside the larger space.  
For example, points on a 2D surface in ℝ³ fill only that surface, not the whole space.  
So although the ambient space has d = 3, the intrinsic dimension is m = 2.

---

Q2.5: Why does the intrinsic dimension matter?  
It shows the true complexity of the data.  
If m is small, nearby points stay meaningfully close,  
and distances capture structure.  
If m is large, points spread out and distances become less useful,  
making it harder to find patterns or neighbors.

# Interpretation
A: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence distances?
B: How does intrinsic dimension (m) influence neighborhood structure?

Write both the formal and intuitive meanings of all core terms.

intrinsic dimension
I1: part and parcel of the system. It tells how many independent directions belong to the system itself.
one for a line, two for a plane, three for a volume.
F1: Let M ⊂ ℝᵈ be a smooth manifold of dimension m. 
Then the intrinsic dimension of M is m; it is the number of independent coordinates needed to describe points on M.
M is a subset of R to the power d.

### Core objects

## manifold M ⊂ ℝᵈ
I1:
When I think of a manifold, I imagine standing on a smooth surface. 
It feels flat right under my feet, but I can move in more than one direction.
There are a multitude of directions.
Those small, flat regions connect smoothly everywhere, 
so even if the whole shape is curved, locally it behaves like flat space.
That’s what “vielfache” means to me: having many directions of freedom that fit together smoothly.

F1:
A smooth manifold of dimension m is a set M such that every point x ∈ M
has a neighborhood U ⊂ M and a map φ : U → ℝᵐ that is a homeomorphism onto its image.
The collection of such pairs (U, φ) is called an atlas.
If all transition maps φ_j ∘ φ_i⁻¹ between overlapping charts are smooth,
then M is a smooth (differentiable) manifold.

## point on the manifold x ∈ M

## atlas { (U_i, φ_i) }
## ambient space ℝᵈ
## intrinsic dimension m

## distance function d(x, y)
## neighborhood Nᵣ(x)

# Scaling Law and Geometric Meaning

Neighbourhood growth:
N(r) ∝ rᵐ

Interpretation:
The number of points within radius r grows roughly like r to the power m.
This defines how distance and density scale with the intrinsic dimension m.

Small m:
– Distances reflect real similarity.
– Neighbourhoods are well-structured.
– Geometry-based methods remain stable.

Large m:
– Distances become less informative.
– Most points are nearly equidistant.
– Nearest-neighbour and geometric algorithms become unstable.

Conclusion:
The intrinsic dimension m governs how distance behaves
and determines the effectiveness of geometry-based methods
in high-dimensional data.
