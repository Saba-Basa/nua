[Data responsibility]

Decide which variables are relevant predictors and which variable is the target, 
excluding irrelevant or confounding information.

In predictive modeling, expert knowledge is needed to choose relevant data, 
because irrelevant or confounding information can weaken the predictive signal and harm model performance.

[PREDICTIVE MODELING PROCESS]

Major Question:
How do we correctly transform raw data into a model that generalizes?

Pipeline:

1. Data Understanding
   - What is the prediction objective?
   Definition:
    "The predictors, independent variables, attributes, 
    or descriptors are the data used as input for the prediction equation."
    (Kuhn & Johnson, Applied Predictive Modeling, 2013, Ch. 1.3)
    - the input data
    Function:
    - represent the input data
    Condition:
    It applies when a predictive model is constructed or used to generate predictions
    for example:
    when computing ^y(target) from X (all predictors: features).
    Design reason:
    Why is this concept structured this way?
    - to separate inputs from the quantity being predicted
    - so the model can learn a mapping X->y
    (fitting a function from inputs to 
    outputs under an error criterion)
    Boundary:
    they're seperate to what?.
    Predictors must not include or encode the target.
    the target is the output.

   - What is X (predictors)?
   Definition:
      - X is a matrix of predictors with n rows (data points) and P columns (predictors)
   Function: What role does X play in the modeling process?
      - X provides the input data from which the model computes predictions.
   Condition: when does X apply or occur?
      - it applies when a predictive model is constructed and needs input data to generate predictions.
   Design reason: 
      Why is X represented as a matrix with 
      rows = data points and columns = predictors?
      What would break if X were not structured this way?
      -Rows represent samples and columns represent predictors 
      because learning algorithms rely on linear algebra operations 
      such as parameter estimation, similarity measurement, 
      and model updates that require each data point 
      to be represented as a vector in a fixed feature space.

      ======
      WHY A VECTOR SPACE?

      Learning algorithms rely on linear algebra.

      • Parameters: each predictor needs a fixed position so parameters stay aligned.
      • Comparison: distance, similarity, and projection only exist for vectors.
      • Learning: gradients and updates require coordinates and vector operations.

      Therefore:
      - predictors = dimensions
      - samples = vectors
      - X = matrix of vectors

      This is a structural necessity, not a design choice.

      ======
   Boundary: What would contaminate or invalidate X as pure input data?
      - X must not include or encode the target, or any information derived from it.
      Boundaries protect role purity-> the role of X is to provides the input data

   - What is y (target)?
   Definition:     What is this thing?
      - Is a vector of all n outcome values
      - y is the real observed outcome value in the dataset.
   Function:       What does it do?
      - Provides the ground truth values the model learns to predict.
   Condition:      When does it apply or occur?
 
      During training:
      - Model predicts ŷ
      - ŷ is compared to y
      - Error is computed
      - Model parameters are updated

      y is needed to teach the model.

      During evaluation:
      - Model predicts ŷ
      - ŷ is compared to y
      - Performance metric is computed

      y is needed to judge model quality.

   Design reason:  Why is it designed this way?
   - Y is designed to represent real, 
   measured outcomes, 
   enabling predictions to be compared with the actual results 
   and allowing model error to be computed in supervised learning.

   Boundary:       What must it not do or include?
   -> Boundary is about role puraty
      - y must not
         contain predictions (ŷ).
         include input features (X).
         be modified by the model.

      ======

      Prediction vs Target

      y   = true observed outcome (ground truth)
      ŷ   = model prediction

      Learning minimizes the difference between y and ŷ.

      Example (car fuel economy):
      X = engine displacement, weight, cylinders
      y = measured fuel efficiency in km/L
      ŷ = predicted fuel efficiency in km/L

      ======

2. Preprocessing
   What is this thing?
      Preprocessing is the pipeline stage that 
      occurs after understanding the data and 
      before building and evaluating a model.

   What is its purpose?
      to prepare the data so that models can be built 
      and their performance can be reliably measured.

   Where does it sit in the system or process?
   When does it apply?
      after data understanding and 
      before model building and evaluation.

   Under what situation is it used?
      when preparing data for building and evaluating predictive models.
      
   What is it NOT responsible for?
   What must it explicitly not do?
      the data must be in a form suitable for model building and performance evaluation.

   What must be true when it finishes?
         predictors and outcomes must be prepared so the 
         data can be split, models can be fit, 
         and performance can be measured.

   What rules limit it?
      preprocessing must be guided by data characteristics and the modeling objective.

   What can change depending on context or data?
      the specific preprocessing steps depend on the structure, scale, and quality of the input data.
