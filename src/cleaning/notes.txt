[Data responsibility]

Decide which variables are relevant predictors and which variable is the target, 
excluding irrelevant or confounding information.

In predictive modeling, expert knowledge is needed to choose relevant data, 
because irrelevant or confounding information can weaken the predictive signal and harm model performance.
(Kuhn & Johnson, Applied Predictive Modeling, 2013, Ch. 1.2)

[Notation]
- X : all predictors (features), shape (n, P)
    X  (NumPy array / pandas DataFrame)

- y : target / response, length n
    y  (1D array / Series)

- x_ij : value of feature j for sample i
    X[i, j] or X.iloc[i, j]

- x_i : feature vector for sample i (row i of X)
    code: X[i, :] or X.iloc[i, :]

- n : number of samples (rows)
- P : number of features (columns)
