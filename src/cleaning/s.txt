SOFTWARE REASONING TEMPLATE
===========================

ANCHOR
------
What software unit is this?
(if / function / class / module / pipeline step)


STEP 0 — CLASSIFY
-----------------
What is being implemented?

Definition:
What is this unit?

Responsibility:
What SINGLE job does it perform?

Trigger:
When is this executed?

Design Reason:
Why must this exist as its own unit?

Boundary:
What must it NOT handle?


STEP 1 — ISOLATE UNIT
---------------------
Name the operation in one short phrase.

Remove:
- UI
- domain story
- examples
- side concerns


STEP 2 — INPUT / OUTPUT
-----------------------
Input:
What data enters?

Output:
What data leaves?

Format:
Primitive / object / table / state / signal?


STEP 3 — SYSTEM POSITION
------------------------
Where does this live?

BEFORE:
What runs before it?

AFTER:
What consumes its output?

Dependency role:
Producer / transformer / consumer?


STEP 4 — SCOPE CONTROL
----------------------
Included:
What logic belongs here?

Excluded:
What logic must stay outside?


STEP 5 — IMPLEMENTATION DECISION
--------------------------------
Reuse:
Is there an existing library/tool?

State:
Stateless or stateful?

Side effects:
Allowed or forbidden?


STEP 6 — RESOLVE
----------------
One-sentence contract:

"Takes ___ and produces ___ for ___."


FAIL–FAST
---------
If responsibility, inputs, or outputs are unclear — STOP and redesign.
